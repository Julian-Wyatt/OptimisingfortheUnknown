# Optimising for the Unknown

## MICCAI Cephalometric Landmark Detection Challenge

This repository contains the code for the paper "Optimising for the Unknown: Domain Alignment for Cephalometric Landmark Detection"

### Abstract
Cephalometric Landmark Detection is the process of identifying key areas for cephalometry. Each landmark is a single ground truth (GT) point labelled by a clinician.
A machine learning model predicts the probability locus of a landmark represented by a heatmap.
This work, for the 2024 CL-Detection MICCAI Challenge, proposes a domain alignment strategy with a regional facial extraction module and an X-ray artefact augmentation procedure.
The challenge ranks our methodâ€™s results as the best in mean radial error (MRE) of 1.186mm and third in the 2mm successful detection rate (SDR) of 82.04% on the online validation leaderboard.
